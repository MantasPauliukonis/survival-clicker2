## Intro

Currently I'm implementing the base functionality for the game. Once it's done, I'll announce the `0.1` alpha release. This can only happen when [Game Basics](docs/Design-Document/Game-Basics-2b1a9919-aaaa-4a60-92ef-09ce8b88e96b.md) are implemented. Then I'll start to implement the [Modules](docs/Design-Document/Modules-c911879c-ec8c-4106-86d0-a8b9468d5bb8.md).

You can find the whole design document [here](docs/Design-Document/Design-Document-e000f04c-b05b-4dfc-83b0-3770f478d276.md).
