# Effects

# Dependency

—

# Outline

- game engine rather than gameplay module
- outsources various effects into their own layer of interactions, making further development more open and streamlined
- effects may be temporary and permanent; temporary have a set expiration timeout, and permanent are triggered by certain conditions
    - e.g. drug effects are temporary
    - e.g. Starvation (see below) is permanent

# Examples

- `stomach == 0` produces the Starvation effect, which reduces health over time
- `stamina ≤ 0` produces the Exhausted effect; working when Exhausted reduces health per each work action
