# Outline

- the Hobo has stress (S) stat, ranging from zero to 1000
- S drops over time, and increases with work
- S can be reduced with entertainment
    - e.g., watching TV
    - e.g., reading a book
    - e.g., going to an ice rink (in winter)
- [?] exercise [Physical Fitness](https://www.notion.so/d88ac051-f9c1-4c61-9d72-b72364363604) and similar activities (swimming) lowers stress
    - TFG: I believe this is the consensus among health specialists; per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise#Neurobiological): "A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise (e.g., 30 minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain cognitive functions <...> some of these long-term effects include: <...> improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control of behavior <...>"
- the desirable / ideal value of S is zero
- the higher S gets, the more severe the permanent effect it produces
    - severity is broken down by level, per 200 units of S
- the Hobo may have neurological diseases, such as depression, ADHD, OCD etc., each with their own set of effects
    - the effects needn't always be negative:
        - e.g., depression may offer better stress coping
        - e.g., ADHD may give immense amounts of energy
        - e.g., OCD may provide the Hobo with increased effects of H [Hygiene](https://www.notion.so/30765a19-f0eb-4d28-b1d2-ee32a0f82e3d)
- [?] depending on the idea behind the prestige system [Prestige Mechanic](https://www.notion.so/bb1f26e2-869c-4e54-bfec-72c4ea3ea9a4), neurological diseases may come as part of the "negative start" or as challenges, with persistent bonuses provided on completion of certain goals within the challenge
- [?] push this module up the priority and develop other modules based on it?
    - TFG: this seems like a more basic module than, say, Hygiene or Diseases, as it most concisely deals with survival management
