- Hobo can travel to variety of different locations (L), e.g.:
  - city areas
  - countries
  - planets
- L needs to be unlocked first; costs money to travel
- each L can have it's own individual consumables and/or jobs, taxing policies might be different
- L also serves as a game level; progressing further in the game will unlock more higher tier places
