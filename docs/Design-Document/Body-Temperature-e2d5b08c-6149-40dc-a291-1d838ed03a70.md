# Outline

- the Hobo has body temperature (BT) stat
- BT may rise and fall from different activities and effects
- BT too high or too low has negative effects like:
    - if severe, damages health (very hot or very cold)
    - if hot, hydration usage is increased (hyperthermia)
    - if cold, energy usage is increased (hypothermia)
- clothes allow BT change rate control
    - lighter clothes facilitate BT drop
    - heavier clothes facilitate BT rise
- once specific clothing is bought, later can be interchanged for free
- physical work increases BT
- swimming in the river, drinking cold water and taking cool shower reduce BT
