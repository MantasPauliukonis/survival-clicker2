# Questions and Ideas

# Character

## Main Stats

- how is stamina (re)gained?
- considering all the modules, we currently have a good bunch of stats. For the beginning such amount might be overwhelming to the player; we need to plan how to present (a.k.a unfold) them one by one

## Needs

- what's the purpose of energy? does it translate into stamina?
  - **Resolved**: energy and hydration are both required for stamina to regenerate.
- can some energy be used for automatic togglable actions?
  - e.g., brushing teeth from the Hygiene module
  - if the Hobo starts with very low energy, being able to afford certain actions would be one of the goals

# Gameplay

## Jobs

- Will jobs have a cool down timer? (individually)
  - ones that don't drain stamina for example, but yield high income. Or we should rather limit them with [Emotional States](https://www.notion.so/bcd801cf-b933-418b-819d-3c163a8c8b7d)

## Money

- income or wealth tax? (income taxation or current money taxation?)
