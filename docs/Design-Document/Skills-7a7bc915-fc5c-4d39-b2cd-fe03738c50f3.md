# Reasoning

In the original player unlocked most of the items purely by an ability to afford them. Having skills allows for more diversity in game progression; letting players to choose their way of progressing, rather than having everything laid out in a linear manner.

# Outline

- skills (SK) define how good Hobo is at doing something
- each has level and gained experience
- every level takes progressively more experience; prestiging can make Hobo level up faster,  therefore allowing to advance further (ties into: [Prestige Mechanic](https://www.notion.so/bb1f26e2-869c-4e54-bfec-72c4ea3ea9a4))
- any time any SK receives a level-up, it increments a global level-up counter; which increases XP required for all skills; this prevents player from leveling up everything during a single prestige [?]
- each SK has it's own set of perks (PK)
  - each PK requires a minimum skill level
  - when unlocked can be bought/taken using some resource (e.g. money) [?]
