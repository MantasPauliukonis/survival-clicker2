# Outline

- jobs and consumables marked as illegal will raise character's crime level (CL)
- CL gain is entirely dependent on the current location (see: [Locations](https://www.notion.so/cf0e1de8-3ded-4089-bd94-853e15b2ad91))
- once CL reaches certain threshold, Hobo is arrested and taken to jail
  - leverages location mechanics (see: [Locations](https://www.notion.so/cf0e1de8-3ded-4089-bd94-853e15b2ad91))
  - unlike other locations, can not be left until sentence is over
- Hobo has an option to pay fines if crime is not severe
