# Outline

- the Hobo has organ structure as a system of stats
- each organ has their job within the system
- organs can receive damage from various activities or consumables; consequences can be health but only to an extent
- if an organ is missing, its job is unfulfilled and no benefit is granted
    - e.g., without one lung, stamina regeneration is halved
- organs may be replaced with substitute or enhanced versions
