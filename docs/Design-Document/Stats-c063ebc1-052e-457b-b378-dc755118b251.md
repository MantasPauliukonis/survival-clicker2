# Stats

# Outline

- the Hobo has defined statistics (ST)
- two types of stats exist
    - Standard Stat
        - contains value (VAL) of the stat
        - has configurable minimum (MIN); defaults to zero if not specified
        - the VAL is persistent; and is affected by actions
            - e.g., consuming food adds to the stomach's VAL
    - Container Stat
        - extends standard stat; also contains maximum value (MAX)
        - MAX is calculated using formula; using [Modifiers](https://www.notion.so/b18bf83c-5726-460a-adbf-eb58e63f3f0e), optionally
        - VAL can not exceed MAX; nor can not be lower than specified MIN
- ST can be set to be *volatile* or *permanent;* for example:
    - health; if Hobo dies health resets back to starting value
    - reincarnation points; if Hobo dies, he keeps this ST
- ST has a category to which it belongs to; defines it's usage in a way; here are some examples:
    - health — character stats (visual: progress bar)
    - money — game stats (visual: formatted label)
    - death count — other statistics (visual: row in game statistics dialog)
